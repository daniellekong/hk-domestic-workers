				In a society where they work for families but are not necessarily considered part of the family, foreign domestic workers (FDW) struggle for space and with community building in densely populated Hong Kong.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project explores the urban spaces that FDW use on Sundays, the weekly day off for most workers. While FDW often play an invisible role within the household, on Sundays, they become a visible population to society. FDW live and work in their employers' abodes. Some have their own private small room; others frequently sleep in the children's room or in spaces that function as part of the employers' living space during the day. Not having their own homes and spaces to interact with friends, FDW occupy public spaces and “quasi-public spaces” outdoors to rest, to socialize, and to take care of personal tasks they normally don’t have a chance to during the workweek.

					The majority of Hong Kong’s population is ethnically Chinese. FDW make up a sizeable portion of Hong Kong’s ethnic minority; these workers mainly come from the Philippines and Indonesia. While most signage in Hong Kong features Chinese and English, this sign also includes Filipino (being in an area – Central’s Chater Garden – where many Filipino FDW congregate on Sundays).

					On a footbridge outside of United Centre in Admiralty, cardboard boxes are laid out ready for purchase (HK$10). After attending church, many Filipino FDW come to this space and buy these boxes to sit on.

					At 10:30 am, a group of Filipino FDW have their nails done by friends. The woman having her nails painted in this photo worked as a conductress in the Philippines for 15 years before moving to Hong Kong because of the higher salary. Professor Robyn Magalit Rodriguez states the idea succinctly: “Employment abroad allows Philippine citizens to earn incomes far greater than would be possible in the Philippines (in part because the peso is so devalued) and therefore sustain their families’ well-being, at least for the immediate future” (from Migrants for Export: How the Philippine State Brokers Labor to the World). With five children and a handful of grandchildren, this woman left her home country to work abroad with the goal of supporting family and friends living back in the Philippines.

					Victoria Park is a a major destination for Indonesian FDW to gather on Sundays. This photo was taken at 11:00 am on a sweltering hot day. Regardless of the weather, FDW take to the outdoor spaces because they often don’t have their own private spaces in their employers’ homes and need to get away from those places where they spend most of their time. Workers from different countries are known for frequenting different parts of the city: Central is where Filipinos go, Victoria Park and Causeway Bay are where Indonesians congregate, Kowloon City is where many Thai workers are found, and Tsim Sha Tsui and Sha Tin host an assortment of nationalities.

					Lo Ka Man Claire states that “private shopping malls, the atria inside, the tunnels or bridges leading to these malls and all the passages of the MTR are all quasi-public space…Once we enter a quasi-public space, we are under the control and surveillance of the private sectors” (from A Critical Study of the Public Space in Hong Kong). I was told that while there may not be written laws about restrictions on use of space, there are common practices in “quasi-public spaces” that discriminate against some ethnic minorities. As seen in this photo, a guard at New Town Plaza, a mall in Sha Tin, tells a woman to move closer to the edge of the stairway.

					At mid-day under the HSBC Building, a group of friends sit circled around food they have brought for the day. Finding community and friendship in a place away from home was a central theme that came to light in many of the conversations I had with FDW.

					This photo shows a collection of items spotted next to a FDW who was educated as a civil engineer in the Philippines. Unable to find work as an engineer after graduation, she moved to Hong Kong to work as a FDW and has been in the city for over 20 years. She tells me that people think lowly of FDW but not her – “I put it higher,” she says. “I am proud to be a domestic worker.”

					The toilet queues in malls and other quasi-public spaces are often long on Sundays. An individual who works for a domestic worker advocacy group in Hong Kong told me that guards are sometimes instructed to prevent people who look like FDW from using these bathrooms.

					Some groups of people use cardboard boxes to build forts, seeking privacy in the open area. A FDW I met told me that "it's like their house.” The built physical structure represents their individual space. Most FDW stay out the whole Sunday before returning to their employers' homes to get ready for another 6-day workweek.
